	<h2>I love art so very much. It is something that I am most passionate about. I am inspired by cartoons and animation; it influences how I go about making my pieces. I tend to like to go about topics in a more light-hearted manner. I do not enjoy taking myself too seriously. I want to have fun making my art pieces and I want the audience to have fun observing them. That being said, I can indulge in serious topics from time to time. I still try to put my upbeat personality in there somewhere. For this class I worked a lot on the theme of how I choose to express myself.</h2>
