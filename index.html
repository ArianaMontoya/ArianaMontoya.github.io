    This video is a experimental narrative piece. It follows me as I experiment with fashion as a way of expressing myself and my emotions. I have multiple ways I like to dress, and I choose how I want to look based on how I feel that day. Some days I feel more feminine; other days I want to look handsome. All these are a part of my identity, and I like expressing them through my wardrobe. The narrative part of the video is the text that pops up on screen. Words, color, font, and animations all were chosen to match my mood connected to each outfit. This not only helps it look nice together, but also represents how I put so much detail into how I present myself. I take pride in how I look; not so much if I'm trendy, but if I feel good in what I'm wearing.

   This is a non-narrative video following the theme of my personal life with ADD. I am focusing on the more positive aspects of my disability, and demonstrating them through the use of visual stimulations that I find most appealing.
